# CalorieFit
### About the project
This app has been made as a project for mobile development at my University. It is a simple app that lets the user comfortably handle their calories by adding different meals with their calorie value.
We can set a limit of calories and the app displays in a progress bar if we are still in limit. The user can add and edit all food (also take a picture of the product).
